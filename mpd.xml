    <description>The experimental gentoo overlay was designed as a
      way to keep up-to-date. Most of it are live ebuilds, ebuilds
      that pull the latest HEAD from whatever repository. It also
      includes ebuilds for clients that are not yet in portage. It is
      maintained by gregf, send new ebuilds, corrections or bugs
      directly to him.</description>
